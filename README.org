* Why I Open This Object ?
  I use this object to gain the ability to implement a compiler.
  Actually, I want to finish this task in a more theorical way.
  That is, I want to avoid the using of the traditional tools like =Lex= and =Yacc=.
  I want to finish this project using the theory that I learn directly from books and papers.

* What I Have Already Done ?
** A Lex Analyzer
   It read regular expressoins and convert them to a determined finite automata.
   And I use this automata to capture the _tokens_ from the input stream.
** A LR(k) Parser
   It takes a Grammer $G$, and build a parse tree for each finite input string.
   I learn this algorithm from <<On the Translation of Language from Left to Right>>
   which is written by /Donald E. Knuth/
